# C-- Compiler

This project implements a compiler for the **C-- language**, developed as part of the coursework for the *Programming Language Design* subject.

# 📜 Overview

The C-- compiler supports all classical compilation phases:

1. **Lexical analysis** using ANTLR4
2. **Syntactic analysis** and AST generation
3. **Semantic analysis**, including:
    - Name resolution (Identification)
    - Type checking
    - Offset computation
4. **Code generation** targeting the **MAPL** assembly language

# ✅ Supported Features

- [x] Built-in types: `int`, `char`, `double`, arrays, structs, functions
- [x] Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `&&`, `||`, `!`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- [x] Type casting (explicit)
- [x] Input/output operations: `read`, `write`
- [x] Functions with parameters and return types
- [x] Global and local variable support with proper scoping
- [x] Field access (`.`) and array indexing (`[]`)
- [x] Code generation with correct offsets and stack frame layout


# External Tools
Some external tools are used in this project:
- Introspector [`LICENSE-Introspector`](./LICENSE-Introspector) to visualize as trees runtime object structures (AST)
- ANTLR for parsing and grammar processing 
- MAPL, a virtual machine to execute the programs generated by the compiler (not currently in the project)

# 🛠️ Run from IntelliJ IDEA
- Go to Run > Edit Configurations...
- Select your Main class
- Set Program arguments to: input.txt
- Set VM options to: -ea
- Apply and run 
- 
## To generate the ANTLR parser automatically in IntelliJ:
- Install the ANTLR v4 plugin
- Right-click your .g4 grammar file → "Generate ANTLR Recognizer"
- It will automatically generate the parser and lexer Java file

# 🧪 Behavior
If the program has no semantic errors:
- output.txt is generated
- The code runs correctly in MAPL.jar

If there are semantic or syntax errors:
- They are printed to the console
- output.txt is not generated
